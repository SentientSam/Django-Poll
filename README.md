# Django-Poll
Introduction to Django via a poll application

This repo is for Django projects I am working on. 
My plans currently are to finish creating a polls application to solidify the fuindamentals and then move on to making a portfolio application.
The purpose of Django for me was to test it out as a potential framework for a project myself and a friend are working on however I do not feel like it fits my needs quite as much as I would like.
